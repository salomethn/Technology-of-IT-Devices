## Lecture 1

1. What does voltage logic mean? What are the most common power supply voltages?

   Logic voltage is the voltage associate with the logic value 0 *(low)* and the logic value 1 *(high)*.

   Common power supply:

   * 5V

   * 3.3V

   * 2.5V

   * 1.8V

  Voltage depend on the size of transistors.

2. Name three passive electronic components.

   * Resistor
   * Capacitor
   * Inductance

3. Shortly describe Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL).

   The sum of currents in any given node is zero.

4. Shortly describe Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL).

   The sum of voltages in any given loop is zero.

5. What does the time constant mean in the case of an RC network? How can we calculate it?

   The time it takes for the step response to reach 1 - 1/e (63.2%) of it's final value.

   `τ = RC`
